# AnyChart Elasticsearch Integration
This example presents to you how to use Anychart library with the search and analytics engine Ealsticsearch.

## Running

To use this sample you need to have Elasticsearch installed. If you donâ€™t have it, please, visit the [Elastic download page](https://www.elastic.co/start) or install it with WGET utility using this install guide. You should have JDK 6 or above, and NPM - package manager for Node.js.

To run Elasticsearch server and check its status, execute the following command in Elasticsearch installed folder:
```
bin/elasticsearch
```
or this one on Windows:
```
bin\elasticsearch.bat
```
Elasticsearch is now running. You can access it at http://localhost:9200 in your web browser or get info with CURL:
```
curl http://localhost:9200/
```

**To start this example run the commands listed below.**

Clone the repository from github.com:
```
git clone git@github.com:anychart-integrations/elasticsearch-basic-sample.git
```

Navigate to the repository folder:
```
cd elasticsearch-basic-sample
```

Install dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Put some test data to the Elasticsearch instance where 'testbase' is intended for an index, 'dataset' is for a type and '1' is for an id:
```
curl -XPOST -H'Content-Type: application/json' http://localhost:9200/testbase/dataset/1 -d '{"data":[{"x":"Apples", "value": "128"},{"x":"Oranges", "value": "99"},{"x":"Lemons", "value": "54"},{"x":"Bananas", "value": "150"}] }'
```

Run the sample:
```
npm start
```

Now open browser at http://localhost:8080/

## Useful commands
While Elasticsearch is running you may use commands to:

1. Get the current mapping of index 'testbase':
```
curl -XGET -H'Content-Type: application/json' "http://localhost:9200/testbase/_mapping?pretty"
```

2. Get the document from index 'testbase' with the type 'dataset' and id '1':
```
curl -XGET "http://localhost:9200/testbase/dataset/1?pretty"
```

3. Delete existing index 'testbase' from the Elasticsearch instance:
```
curl -XDELETE http://localhost:9200/testbase
```
